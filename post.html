                           <p> &nbsp;Without coffee breaks, productivity would likely drop and staff morale would fall rapidly. With that in mind, take a look at some of the benefits of taking coffee breaks during the working day.</p>

                           <p> &nbsp;Coffee breaks offer time to de-stress and relax,

                            No matter how much you love your job there is no denying that work can be stressful. High workloads, complicated tasks and tight deadlines can all aid feelings of stress, making employees frustrated or anxious. A coffee break offers staff a much-needed step away from the pressure and allows them some time to relax.</p>

                            <P> &nbsp;Coffee breaks also help keeps you awake and alert,

                            Work can be taxing on the brain, which can lead employees to feel tired and worn out. A much-needed caffeine hit can help staff to feel awake and alert again, meaning they will be able to focus on the tasks at hand. Coffee is known to improve performance and memory, making the brain work more efficiently.
                            </P>
                            
                            <P> &nbsp;Coffee breaks encourage workplace friendships,

                            Coffee breaks are a perfect opportunity for employees to get to know each other and form friendships. These friendships make for a strong team, which will work well together and support each other. It also means that there will be a positive atmosphere in the office, as employees will bond and create healthy colleague relationships. Enjoying being around the people you work with really aids job satisfaction too, so you will find yourself with a happier and more enthusiastic workforce.
                            </P>
